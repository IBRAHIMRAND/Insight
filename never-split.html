  <h2>Become a master negotiator </h2>
  <h2>Have you tried and failed to convince your partner to go to a new restaurant, a car salesman to give a better deal, or a potential client to sign on to your business pitch? Most of us fail to convince others on a fairly regular basis, No matter how hard we try; our pleas fall on deaf ears </h2>
  <h2>That is because we are not negotiating right</h2>
  <h2>Humans negotiate in every part of life .In other word, while negotiating is what the police do when dealing with hostage situation; it is also something that happens at work, at home, with your partner and with your kids.In simple way negotiating is just trying to get things to go your way, it is having an interaction or communication with specific outcomes in mind, Whenever two or more people want something from one another, negotiation is taking place. Say you want a raise and your boss wants your salary to stay where it is, or maybe you want your kids to go to bed by eight, but they want to stay up till ten. </h2>
  <h2>Are you see, negotiation is more common than most people think, but what makes for a successful negotiation?</h2>
  <h2>It is more than just mathematical logic, and a keen intellect. That is because humans aren’t always rational; they often fail to act on the basis of logic or reason, To make matters more complicated humans aren’t always predictable either , people often act based on their nature , which is irrational , spontaneous , that is precisely what the researchers found after years of study , Their findings challenged conventional thinking on negotiation . </h2>
  <h2>Here is how</h2>
  <h2>In the 1970s, when negotiation fist became defined as a field, it was based on the assumption that each individual acted rationally and to their own advantage, however, 2 researchers discovered that humans are prone to what is called cognitive bias, which makes them unconsciously irrational they even identified 150 types of biases.</h2>
  <h2>Simply put, to be a successful negotiator, your approach has to take into account the complex nature of humankind.  </h2>
